## Benjamin Leutner

I am a PhD student at the Department of Remote Sensing, at the University of WÃ¼rzburg, Germany and an environmental scientist by training.
My research interests lay in the application of remote sensing in ecology and biodiversity research.  I work primarily with airborne hyperspectral imagery and
full-waveform lidar data, yet the odd multispectral scene slips in every now and then as well. 
I firmly believe in the importance of using free and open-source software (free as in freedom), especially in the educational and scientific domain. While R certainly wasn't born, 
handling large spatial data-sets it has come a very long way and thanks to efforts such as the sp and raster packages it has evolved into a full fledged GIS and only very rarely do I find myself switching to QGIS, GRASS or SAGA instead.
