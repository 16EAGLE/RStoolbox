## ... the author 

My name is Benjamin Leutner. I am a PhD student at the Department of Remote Sensing, at the University of WÃ¼rzburg, Germany and an environmental scientist by training.
My research interests lay in the application of remote sensing in ecology and biodiversity research.  I work primarily with airborne hyperspectral imagery and
full-waveform lidar data, yet the odd multispectral scene slips in every now and then as well. 
I firmly believe in the importance of using free and open-source software (free as in freedom), especially in the educational and scientific domain. While R certainly wasn't born, 
handling large spatial data-sets it has come a very long way and thanks to efforts such as the sp and raster packages it has evolved into a full fledged GIS and only very rarely do I find myself switching to QGIS, GRASS or SAGA instead.


## ... the package

RStoolbox is written mostly in [Wickham style](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/): documentation is managed by [roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html), package maintenance, checking and building by [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) and testing by [testthat](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html). The primary building-blocks of RStoolbox certainly are the [raster](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html) and [sp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html) packages, complemented by the impressive modelling framework of the [caret](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/index.html) package. Whenever possible I try to make use of R's parallel processing capabilities (all you have to do is register the back-end) brought to you by [parallel](http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/parallel), [doParallel](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doParallel/index.html) and [snow](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/snow/index.html).
