# RStoolbox

RStoolbox is in initial development. We aim to provide fundamental remote sensing image processing and 
analysis tools for R, such as unsupervised and supervised classification or image regression (fractional cover).

## Installation
Please be aware that during initial development function and argument names are likely to change.
Only once the package is submitted to CRAN they will remain stable.
