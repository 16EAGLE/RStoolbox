## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. I have reduced the running times of the examples from cloudMask, cloudShadowMask and pifMatch to
stay below 5s on my machines by excluding unnecessary plots from running in tests.

## Test environments

* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), (oldrel, release, devel)
* win-builder (release, devel)
